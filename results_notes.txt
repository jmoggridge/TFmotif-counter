Enriched and depleted transcription factor binding sites in promoter regions of query genes vs random genes in Zea mays:

Overall, none of the differences seem very extreme in terms of fold-change or absolute counts. The only large fold changes are in those with few occurrences; the fold-changes of more common motifs are generally small. It is difficult to guess whether of any the differences are actually significant without collecting further random sampling to get a more accurate expectation value.

Some examples that had notable differences between the two sets:

motif 	   | count in genes | count in random
